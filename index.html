              This data was pulled from the US Census Bureau 1 year estimates in
              2014, so a further and more robust analysis would include more
              recent years. However, it is still valuable information to study,
              as the trends shown during 2014 are most likely very similar to
              our current year of 2021.

              The variables I thought were the most interesting were lack of
              healthcare compared to percentage of poverty in the state. This
              analysis shows Texas being the state with the highest poverty rate
              as well as highest rates of those lacking healthcare.
              Massachusetts seems to be the state experiencing the lowest
              numbers of both these variables.
