              Correlations Discovered Between Various Health Risks and <br />
              Age, Median Income, and Poverty
            </h2>
            <br />
            <p>
              The above chart shows the possible correlation between various Health Risks 
              (smoking and obesity) to Age, Median Income, and Poverty in 2014. The US Census
              Bureau has data available to see the trends for 2014, but more data over the recent
              years are important to see if there's an increase, decrease, or remain somewhat equal
              in numbers to recent years up to now in 2021.
            </p>

            <p>
              According to this data, Texas is the state with the worst poverty level and lack of healthcare,
              which is interesting because I initially thought it was Portland or Seattle for the worst poverty 
              level but maybe the lack of 2021 data makes this misleading to current times. Michigan appears to be the state 
              with the lowest lack of healthcare compared to any other state but there is still a decent 
              amount of poverty. New Hampshire appears to have the lowest poverty rate but still some lack of 
              healthcare, which is interesting.
